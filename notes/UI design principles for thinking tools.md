answer the questions:
- [[how can we develop transformative tools for thought]] ?
- [[How do tools contribute to our representations of the world]] ?
- [[Why and how to improve our understanding of systems]] ?

### Seeing the system behavior...

- [[Traditional media restrict our representation of the world]]
- in below example:
	- **Words** describe the **structure** of the algorithm
	- **Pictures** depict the **behavior** of the algorithm.
- Readers are shown the *state of the system* at each step of the algorithm --> They **don't need to simulate** it in their heads
- Readers are shown **relationships between variables**, they don't need to reconstruct them

### the entire behavior (at the same time) ...

- To understand a system, it's not enough to see one variable at a time.
- Show all **all variables at once** to allow for **comparison**
- the following representation show **data** instead of **symbols**

### through multiple linked representations ...

- Show (simultaneously) different ways of interpreting the behavior
- Each representation offers its own unique insights
- Each representation should be linked to the others
- The reader builds **associations** between them.
- This leads to **intuition**, the ability to "feel your way" around a system.

### that are interactive...

- Offer the possibility to **interact directly with behavior** as opposed to *just parameters*.
	- Define and explore **transformations** of the system's variables
	- **Search** and **Selecting** parts of the behavior that meet a condition
	- **Measure** and **reduce** parts of the behavior
	- **Plot** any measurement against any parameter

### created through different modalities

- since our mental models are based on [[the Enactive, Iconic and Symbolic modes of representation]], we should be able to created medium by:
	- **thinking visually**
		- Visualizations tools
	- **hands-on actions**
		- drawing
			- pros: direct, expressive
			- limits: not dynamic
	- **symbolic thinking**
		- code
			- pros: dynamic
			- limits: indirect, symbolic, non-visual
- below is an example of drawing actions software where:
	- drawing actions are **parameterized with variable expressions**
	- a picture  **depend on data**
	- author is not limited to standard chart types
