**Metacognition composed of** [^1]
- planning
	- learning goal
	- learning sequence
	- learning strategies
	- expected learning time
- monitoring
	- activities that moderate the current progress of learning
- evaluating
	- assessment of the current progress
- revising
	- modifying previous plans regarding goals and strategies

**challenge with web-based learning** [^1]
- disorientation (forget what they have to do and where they need to go)

**Metacognitive map to reduce disorientation** [^1]
- *Learning Contents*
	- The current learning content is presented in this frame.
- *Global map*
	- The overall structure of the learning content is represented in the form of global map, similar to a site map
	- Planning:
		- provide a holistic perspective
		- facilitate planning study time and setting priorities
	- Monitoring: 
		- Learners can monitor their learning processes based on the global map by checking how much they have completed relative to the entire content of the site.
- *Local Tracking Map*
	- Whenever learners click a content area of the global map, a new sub-node is generated
	- Monitoring
		-  check what they have already completed/learned and to more easily judge what they need to do next.
	- Evaluating
		-  evaluate and think about their performance with regard to initial goals. 
		-  they can refer to their initial plan in the planning space
- *Planning Space*
	- This space is for premeditated planning of learning tasks. It consists of three parts; learning goal, learning strategies, and expected learning time. All of these parts are revisable at any time.
	- Planning
		- Check their learning goal, expected learning time, and learning strategies in this space.
	- Revising
	- This space can be revised by learners at any time based on their ongoing monitoring and evaluating of their learning. The intent is that learners will adjust their behavior according to the updated plan.
