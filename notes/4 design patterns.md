# Notes
## create interactive puzzle

## have user make prediction
- Example:
	- Instead of showing a graph, makes the user draw what (s)he think the graph would look like

## use role play
- good for exploring hard questions (with no right answers) about philosophy, politics, ethics, or life


## sandbox model
- a big simulation to play around in, with little to no guidance.
- potentially a lot of learning
- but learning requires thinking. And if you give someone a task that's far beyond their current capabilities, they'll just drop it
- start simple and increase complexity step by step
