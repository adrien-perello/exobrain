# limits

 - dataviz people spend too much time thinking about the interactions themselves and less about the audience who is supposed to be using them.

# advice

## time
- how much time has the user?
- be aware of the audience’s context, if they’re actually in the mood for in-depth data exploration

## goal
- keep the user goal in mind
- see visualization As Interface, a way to access the data in a more humane way

## on boarding
- the first moment after opening the page/app is critical
- think about how to bring them to the visualization
	- see [[how I make explorable explanations]], [[explorable explanations by Nicky Case]], [[I do and I understand]]
	- make it about them
