- The concept of spiral curriculum was developed by [[Jerome Bruner]]
- the hypothesis is that  *anything can be taught in some intellectually honest form to anyone*
- the spiral curriculum *guides the structure and presentation of new information* so that even the most complex topic can be understood by every children
- It is based on 3 principles of [^1]:
	- **[[scaffolding]]** 
		- present the topic from the *learner's perspective*
		- link new information with existing knowledge in terms of:
			- relationships
			- context
	- **regular revisit**
		- reinforce and solidify existing knowledge with each visit
	- **complexity progression** with each visit 
		- move from simplistic ideas to complicated ideas 
		- encourage the application of existing knowledge to later course objectives
			- mastery of skills leads to the master of still more powerful ones
