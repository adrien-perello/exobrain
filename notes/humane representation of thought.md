 ### Applications
 
#### dynamic conversations

- explaining and convincing through reasoning and rhetoric with words instead evidence and explorable [[Scientific model]] allowed by new medium
	- what if depicting and describing were as easy?
	- what if creating working models and simulation (backed by evidence and data) were as easy as talking?
		- possible intersection with [[conversational AI]] ?
- today modeling and simulation requires programming and (a lot of) time
	-  should we not question the concept of programming as we currently know it?
		-  [[the future of programming]]
		-  Ken Perlin on chalk talk

#### presentation

- currently works on trust and trustworthy belief (by lack of model representation)
- how do we make use of all the stage space:
	- filling the space with human scale representation and **dynamic material**
	- mapping concept space to physical space
	- the outline of the talk remains visible

#### reading
- one size fits all vs context sensitive material
- what if readers would get more out of the material than the writer put in?
	- same as game designer are curious of what some players end up doing
-  what if reading was like having a dialog with the material
-  what if reading was more like visiting a museum exhibition?

#### browsing, discovering, connecting

#### dynamic authoring

#### creating new knowledge
- representation we hold in our hand and can inspect  from the outside vs a representation we are embedded in and can explore from the inside
- trend towards virtualization since it's the only way to get something dynamic
- and this is only done with computers (screens) at a desk
	- what if computation and programming was a physical action?
	- what would an equation look like in physical space?
