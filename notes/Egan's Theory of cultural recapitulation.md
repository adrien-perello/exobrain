[[Kieran Egan]] argues that there are 5 kinds of understanding:
- **Somatic** understanding is the innate understanding of one's physical functions as well as emotions
- **Mythic** understanding is understanding of "binary opposites" such as Tall/Short or Good/Evil.
- **Romantic** understanding is when the "limits of reality" are discovered (transcendence).
- **Philosophic** understanding is the creation of principles which underlie patterns and limits found in data, and ordering knowledge into coherent general schemes.
- **Ironic** understanding is the "mental flexibility to recognize how inadequately flexible are our minds, and the languages we use, to the world we try to represent in them". This includes the ability to consider alternative philosophic explanations, and is characterized by a Socratic stance in the world.
