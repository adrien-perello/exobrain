### Mathematical notation

*From*:
> a square and 10 roots are equal to 39 units. The question therefore in this type of equation is about as follows: what is the square which combined with ten of its roots will give a sum total of 39? The manner of solving this type of equation is to take one-half of the roots just mentioned. Now the roots in the problem before us are 10. Therefore take 5, which multiplied by itself gives 25, an amount which you add to 39 giving 64. Having taken then the square root of this which is 8, subtract from it half the roots, 5 leaving 3. The number three therefore represents one root of this square, which itself, of course is 9. Nine therefore gives the square.

*To*:  $x² + 10x = 39$

### Infographics

- Wiliam Playfair’s invented the first **bar chart**
- He was actually not the first to invent an infographics
- He was inpired by Joseph Priestley
	- Priestley had created the first timeline charts ( to visualize the life span of a person to compare the life spans of multiple person)s

### Maps

- Harry Beck was the first one to give up geographical accuracy in a map
- he believed that:
	- underground passengers were not concerned with geographical accuracy
	- they were more interested in how to get from one station to another and where to change trains.
