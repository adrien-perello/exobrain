# Notes:

## start with a question

> What makes traditional teaching so ineffective is that it answers questions the student hasn’t thought to ask. You have to help them love the questions. 
> <div class="signature"> Steven Strogatz - "Writing about Math for the Perplexed and the Traumatized" </div>


the question can be:
- put forward straight
- explored through a story
- explored though a game

## bring the learner up the [[ladder of abstraction]]

1. start with a concrete experience
	- the experience should be a good foundation for everything else you'll be building on top of it.
2. build up using **"therefore"** and **"but"**
	- this happens, THEREFORE that happens, BUT that happens, THEREFORE this happens, etc_


## end with another question


# Going further

How can we design explorable explanations :
-   that aren't just single-player
-   that use real-world data
-  where you actually [solve problems, not just puzzles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1_zmx-wU0U)
-   that don't follow a set linear story: it can change its lesson based on the reader's interests & prior knowledge.
-   that are partially user-generated
-   that allow dialogue between peer learners
-  that aren't standalone experiences, but something you can come back to again and again over time.
-   that usen VR, or AR, [or just... R.](https://vimeo.com/71278954)
-  where you can actually make your own projects
-  that go beyond its author, and let you challenge the author's conclusions using the author's own simulation?
-  that augment human intelligence itself, like writing once did
-
