- [[Jerome Bruner]] defines narratives in terms of:
	- **Narrative diachronicity**: The notion that narratives take place over some sense of time.
	- Particularity: The idea that narratives deal with particular **events**, although some events may be left vague and general.
	- **Intentional state entailment**: The concept that characters within a narrative have "beliefs, desires, theories, values, and so on" (7).
	- **Hermeneutic composability**: The theory that narratives are that which can be interpreted in terms of their role as a selected series of events that constitute a "story." See also [Hermeneutics](https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics")
	- **Canonicity** and **breach**: The claim that stories are about something unusual happening that "breaches" the canonical (i.e. normal) state.
	- **Referentiality**: The principle that a story in some way references reality, although not in a direct way that offers verisimilitude.
	- **Genericness**: The flipside to particularity, this is the characteristic of narrative whereby the story can be classified as a genre.
	- **Normativeness**: The observation that narrative in some way supposes a claim about how one ought to act. This follows from canonicity and breach.
	- **Context sensitivity** and **negotiability**: Related to hermeneutic composability, this is the characteristic whereby narrative requires a negotiated role between author or text and reader, including the assigning of a context to the narrative, and ideas like [suspension of disbelief](https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief "Suspension of disbelief").
	- **Narrative accrual**: Finally, the idea that stories are cumulative, that is, that new stories follow from older ones.
