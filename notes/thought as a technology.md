# What makes an interface transformational?
- Language is an example of a [[cognitive technology]]
- *elements of cognition* are things we can think with.
- visual thinking of most non-artist adults is limited to a simple “symbol system”.
	- They take note of what's there, and quickly translate the perception into words and symbols mainly based on the symbol system developed throughout childhood and on what they know about the perceived object.
- giving up geographic fidelity with subway map was not obvious
- same for going for data table to graphs and charts
- interface makes it easy to have insights or make discoveries that were formerly difficult or impossible.

# How can we invent new elements of cognition?

## Heuristic 1: Reify hidden representations in the interface
- gap between the way we teach and how expert think
- (in part) due to traditional media being poorly adapted to the kind of expert representation
- minimal canonical examples
	- stock of concrete example from which expert can abstract and generalize
- tools for exploration by heuristics rather than by rigorous proof

## Heuristic 2: Reify deep principles about the world in the interface
- interface as embodiment of the system principles
	- mastering photoshop means master image manipulation
	- BUT masting MS word does not mean mastering writing


# Conclusion
- **cognitive outsourcing** vs **cognitive augmentation**
- cognitive outsourcing:
	1. we specify a problem
	2. send it to our device 
	3. the device solves it and give us the answer
- cognitive augmentation:
	- can we change the thoughts we can think?
	- what new element of cognition can we invent?
		- unfortunately this is vague and harder to imagine
