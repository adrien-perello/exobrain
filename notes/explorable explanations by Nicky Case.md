# Notes
## do, show and tell
- Don't try to explain everything with something interactive.
- Use interactivity only when interactivity works best, otherwise, supplement it with text & images.
- Overlaps of Do & Show & Tell: when text interacts with the diagrams
	- **Text**: Best at describing very abstract concepts.
	- **Graphs**: Best at showing broad relationships at a glance.  
	- **Animations**: Best at showing temporal relationships.  
	- **Interactives**: Best at showing _processes_, systems, models

## Start small, build big

## test with users
- use content gates to direct the experience and avoid confusion

## see, model and apply
- Let the explorer create their own data points, and form their own model.
	- user modifies firing angle and a plot with landing position vs angle
	- user plays a game and realise that if they play enough times, they will never win when going first
- Embed "homework problems" (well couple with content gating)

## Cognitive Gates
- withholding an explanation can make the explanation more effective

## gamification
- not used to change behavior here, but to motivate learning
-  4 main motivations of why people play games:
	-  Achievers: These people love overcoming problems given to them.
	-  Explorers: These people love digging around in a sandbox, and creating new things (i.e. Minecraft)
	-  Socializers: These people love building relationships with others. Letting explorers share their solutions/creations could appeal to this motive.
	-  Killers: These people love competition.
