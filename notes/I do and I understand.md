# Notes

## define the argument
- define the chain of  **"Cause → Effect"** you want to make.
	- Ex:
		- Indie → Low budget → Less to lose → Can afford more risk → More innovation
		- You want to protect your kid → You don't let them learn from their mistakes → They can't learn by doing → They grow up unprepared and scared → You monster

## turn the argument into a model
- Start simple, then add complexity as the player progresses
- Don't feel bad for simplifying (As long as you get all the important bits, add some nuance, and acknowledge the limitations)

## pay attention to the packaging
- Consider adding a narrative
-
