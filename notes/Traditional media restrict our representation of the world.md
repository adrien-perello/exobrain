- The authors have a **rich picture** in their heads, which they'd like to transmit to the reader's head.
- But traditional media do not facilitate the conversion of rich [[mental representation]]:
	- paper is a **low-bandwidth channel** --> much information is lost

	- They require the reader to **simulate** the state of the system **in their heads**
