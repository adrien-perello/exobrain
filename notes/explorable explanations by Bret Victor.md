# Notes

support [[active reading]]

explorable explanations consists of:
- **reactive document**
	- play with the author's assumptions and analyses
	- see the consequences of certain actions
	- allow different level of reading (from skimming to scenario building)
	- require a model, not just data showing
	- encourage transparency
		- the author needs to disclose its model and data
	- encourage debating
- **explorable example**
	- make the abstract concrete
	- develop an intuition for how a system works
		- especially when multiple representations are available
	- interaction not necessary, only when wishing to explore deeper
	- sandbox are not explanations
	- the author should guide and provide a structure to the learning experience
- **contextual information**
	- just-in-time learning
	- trade-off between curiosity and laziness
	- lower the effort barrier to explore
	-  see the author's text as a base layer for hosting the reader's own explorations
