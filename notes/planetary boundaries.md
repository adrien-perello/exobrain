# planetary boundaries

Planetary boundaries represent [[tipping points]] beyond which catastrophic changes can occur in [[earth system]] processes

They include:
- [[climate change]]
- [[ocean acidification]]
- [[ozone depletion]]
- disruption of [[biogeochemical flows]]
	- [[nitrogen loading]]
	- [[phosphorus loading]]
- [[freshwater consumption]]
- [[land use]]
	- [[deforestation]] is the critical criteria of [[land use]]
- [[biodiversity loss]]
	- is measured by the criteria of
		- [[functional diversity]]
		- [[genetic diversity]]
- [[atmospheric aerosol loading]] includes
	- [[primary-aerosol-sources]]
		- ocean
		- fires
		- vulcanoes
		- air blown disruption
		- human activities
	- [[secondary-aerosol-sources]]
		- plankton
		- land vegetations
- [[chemical pollution]]
