> "**(Yellow)** - For example, people do not generate sufficient alternative explanations or consider enough rival hypotheses. People generally do not adequately control for confounding variables when they explore a novel environment. People's judgments are strongly affected by the frame in which the information is presented, even when the objective information is unchanged. People suffer from overconfidence in their judgments (underestimating uncertainty), wishful thinking (assessing desired outcomes as more likely than undesired outcomes), and the illusion of control (believing one can predict or influence the outcome of random events). People violate basic rules of probability, do not understand basic statistical concepts such as regression to the mean, and do not update beliefs according to Bayes' rule. Memory is distorted by hindsight, the availability and salience of examples, and the desirability of outcomes. And so on"

> "**(Yellow)** - tendency to seek evidence consistent with current beliefs rather than potential disconfirmation" 
>([Sterman 2000:55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=55))

#### **(Orange)** - a choice that can only provide data consistent with the theory, but cannot test it

#### **(Orange)** - Many people place their faith in what Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor called "miracle, mystery, and authority," for example, astrology, ESP, UFOs, creationism, conspiracy theories of history, channeling of past lives, cult leaders promising Armageddon, and Elvis sightings.

> "**(Yellow)** - Such lunacy aside, there are deeper and more disturbing reasons for the prevalence of these learning failures and the superstitions they engender. Human beings are more than cognitive information processors. We have a deep need for emotional and spiritual sustenance." 
>([Sterman 2000:56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=56))

> "**(Yellow)** - science has stripped away ancient and comforting beliefs placing humanity at the center of a rational universe designed for us by a supreme authority. For many people scientific thought leads not to enlightenment and empowerment but to existential angst and the absurdity of human insignificance in an incomprehensibly vast universe." 
>([Sterman 2000:56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=56))

> "**(Yellow)** - Others believe science and technology were the shock troops for the triumph of materialism and instrumentalism over the sacred and spiritual" 
>([Sterman 2000:56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=56))

> "**(Yellow)** - the defensive routines and cultural assumptions people rely on, often unknowingly, to interact with and interpret their experience of others." 
>([Sterman 2000:57](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=57))

#### **(Orange)** - We use defensive routines to save face, assert dominance over others, make untested inferences seem like facts, and advocate our positions while appearing to be neutral. We make conflicting, unstated attributions about the data we receive. We fail to distinguish between the sense-data of experience and the attributions and generalizations we readily form from them. We avoid publicly testing our hypotheses and beliefs and avoid threatening issues. Above all, defensive behavior involves covering up the defensiveness and making these issues undiscussable, even when all parties are aware they exist.

> "**(Yellow)** - Defensive behavior, in which the espoused theories we offer to others differ from our theories in use, prevents learning by hiding important information from others, avoiding public testing of important hypotheses, and tacitly communicating that we are not open to having our mental models challenged" 
>([Sterman 2000:58](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=58))

> "**(Yellow)** - Defensive routines often yield groupthink (Janis 1982), where members of a group mutually reinforce their current beliefs, suppress dissent, and seal themselves off from those with different views or possible disconfirming evidence" 
>([Sterman 2000:58](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=58))

#### **(Orange)** - Defensive routines ensure that the mental models of team members remain ill formed, ambiguous, and hidden. Thus learning by groups can suffer even beyond the impediments to individual learning.

#### **(Orange)** - Local incentives, asymmetric information, and private agendas can lead to game playing by agents throughout a system

#### **(Orange)** - f irreversible actions and high stakes the need to maintain performance often overrides the need to learn

#### **(Orange)** - Virtual worlds have several virtues. First, they provide low-cost laboratories for learning. The virtual world allows time and space to be compressed or dilated. Actions can be repeated under the same or different conditions. One can stop the action to reflect. Decisions that are dangerous, infeasible, or unethical in the real system can be taken in the virtual world. Thus controlled experimentation becomes possible, and the time delays in the learning loop through the real world are dramatically reduced. In the real world the irreversibility of many actions and the need to maintain high performance often override the goal of learning by preventing experiments with untried possibilities ("If it ain't broke, don't fix it")

> "**(Yellow)** - Virtual worlds are effective when they engage people in what Dewey called "reflective thought" and what Schon (1992) calls "reflective conversation with the situation."" 
>([Sterman 2000:60](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=60))

#### **(Orange)** - Many participants in system dynamics projects lack training in scientific method and awareness of the pitfalls in the design and interpretation of experiments.

#### **(Orange)** - the video game syndrome in which people play too much and think too little.

> "**(Yellow)** - People often do not take time to reflect on the outcome of a simulation, identify discrepancies between the outcomes and their expectations, formulate hypotheses to explain the discrepancies, and then devise experiments to discriminate among the competing alternatives" 
>([Sterman 2000:61](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=61))

> "**(Yellow)** - proper procedure, such as keeping laboratory notebooks, explicitly formulating hypotheses and presenting them to the group, and so on" 
>([Sterman 2000:61](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=61))

#### **(Orange)** - Defensive routines and groupthink can operate in the learning laboratory just as in the real organization. Indeed, protocols for effective learning in virtual worlds such as public testing of hypotheses, accountability, and comparison of different strategies can be highly threatening, inducing defensive reactions that prevent learning

> "**(Yellow)** - the virtual world must be an open box whose assumptions can be inspected, criticized, and changed" 
>([Sterman 2000:61](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=61))

> "**(Yellow)** - the decision makers participate actively in the development of the model." 
>([Sterman 2000:61](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=61))

#### **(Orange)** - The great virtue of many protocols and tools for elicitation is their ability to improve our models by encouraging people to identify the elements of dynamic complexity normally absent from mental models.

#### **(Orange)** - However, most problem structuring methods yield qualitative models showing causal relationships but omitting the parameters, functional forms, external inputs, and initial conditions needed to fully specify and test the model.

#### **(Orange)** - Simulation speeds and strengthens the learning feedbacks. Discrepancies between formal and mental models

> "**(Yellow)** - Without the discipline and constraint imposed by the rigorous testing enabled by simulation, it becomes all too easy for mental models to be driven by ideology or unconscious bias." 
>([Sterman 2000:62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=62))

> "**(Orange)** - Some people don't believe that models of human behavior can be developed. Simulations of natural and technical systems such as the climate or an oil refinery are based on well-understood laws of physics, but, it is argued, there are no comparably reliable laws of human behavior. This view overestimates our understanding of nature and underestimates the regularities in human decision making" 
>([Sterman 2000:63](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=63))

> "**(Yellow)** - The greatest potential for improvement comes when the modeling process changes deeply held mental models. Yet the more fundamental the mental model you challenge, the more defensive the client may be. To resolve the dilemma the clients must discover the insights for themselves by active participation in the modeling process." 
>([Sterman 2000:67](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=67))

> "**(Yellow)** - 1. Develop a model to solve a particular problem, not to model the system. A model must have a clear purpose and that purpose must be to solve the problem of concern to the client. Modelers must exclude all factors not" 
>([Sterman 2000:104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=104))

> "**(Yellow)** - relevant to the problem to ensure the project scope is feasible and the results timely. The goal is to improve the performance of the system as defined by the client. Focus on results." 
>([Sterman 2000:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=105))

> "**(Yellow)** - 2. Modeling should be integrated into a project from the beginning. The value of the modeling process begins early on, in the problem definition phase. The modeling process helps focus diagnosis on the structure of the system rather than blaming problems on the people making decisions in that structure." 
>([Sterman 2000:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=105))

> "**(Yellow)** - Be skeptical about the value of modeling and force the "why do we need it" discussion at the start of the project. There are many problems for which system dynamics is not useful. Carefully consider whether system dynamics is the right technique for the problem. Modelers should welcome difficult questions from the clients about how the process works and how it might help them with their problem. The earlier these issues are discussed, the better." 
>([Sterman 2000:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=105))

> "**(Yellow)** - System dynamics does not stand alone. Use other tools and methods as appropriate. Most modeling projects are part of a larger effort involving traditional strategic and operational analysis, including benchmarking, statistical work, market research, etc. Effective modeling rests on a strong base of data and understanding of the issues. Modeling works best as a complement to other tools, not as a substitute." 
>([Sterman 2000:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=105))

> "**(Yellow)** - Focus on implementation from the start of the project. Implementation must start on the first day of the project. Constantly ask, How will the model help the client make decisions? Use the model to set priorities and determine the sequence of policy implementation. Use the model to answer the question, How do we get there from here? Carefully consider the real world issues involved in pulling various policy levers. Quantify the full range of costs and benefits of policies, not only those already reported by existing accounting systems." 
>([Sterman 2000:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=105))

> "**(Yellow)** - Modeling works best as an iterative process of joint inquiry between client and consultant. Modeling is a process of discovery. The goal is to reach new understanding of how the problem arises and then use that understanding to design high leverage policies for improvement. Modeling should not be used as a tool for advocacy. Don't build a client's prior opinion about what should be done into a model. Use workshops where the clients can test the model themselves, in real time." 
>([Sterman 2000:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=105))

> "**(Yellow)** - Avoid black box modeling. Models built out of the sight of the client will never lead to change in deeply held mental models and therefore will not change client behavior. Involve the clients as early and as deeply as possible. Show them the model. Encourage them to suggest and run their own tests and to criticize the model. Work with them to resolve their criticisms to their satisfaction." 
>([Sterman 2000:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=105))

> "**(Yellow)** - Validation is a continuous process of testing and building confidence in the model. Models are not validated after they are completed nor by any one test such as their ability to fit historical data. Clients (and modelers) build confidence in the utility of a model gradually, by constantly confronting the model with data and expert opinion-their own and others'. Through this process both model and expert opinions will change and deepen. Seek out opportunities to challenge the model's ability to replicate a diverse range of historical experiences." 
>([Sterman 2000:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=106))

> "**(Yellow)** - Get a preliminary model working as soon as possible. Add detail only as necessary. Develop a working simulation model as soon as possible. Don't try to develop a comprehensive conceptual model prior to the development of a simulation model. Conceptual models are only hypotheses and must be tested. Formalization and simulation often uncover flaws in conceptual maps and lead to improved understanding. The results of simulation experiments inform conceptual understanding and help build confidence in the results. Early results provide immediate value to clients and justify continued investment of their time." 
>([Sterman 2000:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=106))

> "**(Yellow)** - A broad model boundary is more important than a great deal of detail. Models must strike a balance between a useful, operational representation of the structures and policy levers available to the clients while capturing the feedbacks generally unaccounted for in their mental models. In general, the dynamics of a system emerge from the interactions of the components in the system-capturing those feedbacks is more important than a lot of detail in representing the components themselves." 
>([Sterman 2000:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=106))

> "**(Yellow)** - Use expert modelers, not novices. While the software available for modeling is easily mastered by a high school student or CEO, modeling is not computer programming. You cannot develop a qualitative diagram and then hand it off to a programmer for coding into a simulation model. Modeling requires a disciplined approach and an understanding of business, skills developed through study and experience. Get the expert assistance you need. Use the project as an opportunity to develop the skills of others on the team and in the client organization." 
>([Sterman 2000:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=106))

> "**(Yellow)** - Implementation does not end with a single project. In all three cases the modeling work continued to have impact long after the initial project was over. Models and management flight simulators were applied to similar issues in other settings. The modelers developed expertise they applied to related problems and clients moved into new positions and new organizations, taking the insights they gained and, sometimes, a new way of thinking, with them. Implementation is a long-term process of personal, organizational, and social change." 
>([Sterman 2000:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=106))

#### **(Orange)** - designers

#### **(Orange)** - pilots

#### **(Orange)** - managers play both roles. They are pilots, malung decisions (who to hire, what prices to set, when to launch the new product) and they are designers, shaping the organizational structures, strategies, and decision rules that influence how decisions are made

> "**(Yellow)** - e modeling process must be focused on the clients' needs" 
>([Sterman 2000:110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=110))

#### **(Orange)** - are busy. They are embroiled in organizational politics. They are looking out for their own careers. Their concern is solving a problem and taking action in the real world. They care little for the elegance of your theory or cleverness of your model

> "**(Yellow)** - modeling process must be consistent with the clients' skills, capabilities, and goals" 
>([Sterman 2000:110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=110))

> "**(Yellow)** - If the clients perceive your model does not address their concerns or lose confidence in it, you will have little impact. Focus your modeling work on the problems that keep the clients up at night." 
>([Sterman 2000:110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=110))

> "**(Yellow)** - Unfortunately, far too many clients are not interested in learning but in using models to support conclusions they've already reached or as instruments to gain power in their organizations. Sadly, far too many consultants and modelers are only too eager to oblige." 
>([Sterman 2000:110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=110))

> "**(Yellow)** - 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Problem Articulation (Boundary Selection) Theme selection: What is the problem? Why is it a problem? Key variables: What are the key variables and concepts we must consider? Time horizon: How far in the future should we consider? How far back in the past lie the roots of the problem? Dynamic problem definition (reference modes): What is the historical behavior of the key concepts and variables? What might their behavior be in the future? Formulation of Dynamic Hypothesis Initial hypothesis generation: What are current theories of the problematic behavior? Endogenous focus: Formulate a dynamic hypothesis that explains the dynamics as endogenous consequences of the feedback structure. Mapping: Develop maps of causal structure based on initial hypotheses, key variables, reference modes, and other available data, using tools such as Model boundary diagrams, Subsystem diagrams, Causal loop diagrams, Stock and flow maps, Policy structure diagrams, Other facilitation tools. Formulation of a Simulation Model Specification of structure, decision rules. Estimation of parameters, behavioral relationships, and initial conditions. Tests for consistency with the purpose and boundary. Testing Comparison to reference modes: Does the model reproduce the problem behavior adequately for your purpose? Robustness under extreme conditions: Does the model behave realistically when stressed by extreme conditions? Sensitivity: How does the model behave given uncertainty in parameters, initial conditions, model boundary, and aggregation? . . . Many other tests (see chapter 21). Policy Design and Evaluation Scenario specification: What environmental conditions might arise? Policy design: What new decision rules, strategies, and structures might be tried in the real world? How can they be represented in the model? "What if. . ." analysis: What are the effects of the policies? Sensitivity analysis: How robust are the policy recommendations under different scenarios and given uncertainties? Interactions of policies: Do the policies interact? Are there synergies or compensatorv responses?" 
>([Sterman 2000:111](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=111))

> "**(Yellow)** - The most important step in modeling is problem articulation. What is the issue the clients are most concerned with? What problem are they trying to address? What is the real problem, not just the symptom of difficulty? What is the purpose of the model?" 
>([Sterman 2000:114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=114))

#### **(Orange)** - Beware the analyst who proposes to model an entire business or social system rather than a problem

#### **(Orange)** - The usefulness of models lies in the fact that they simplify reality, creating a representation of it we can comprehend. A truly comprehensive model would be just as complex as the system itself and just as inscrutable

#### **(Orange)** - The art of model building is knowing what to cut out, and the purpose of the model acts as the logical knife

> "**(Yellow)** - the modeler develops the initial characterization of the problem through discussion with the client team, supplemented by archival research, data collection, interviews, and direct observation or participation." 
>([Sterman 2000:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=115))

> "**(Yellow)** - set of graphs and other descriptive data showing the development of the problem over time." 
>([Sterman 2000:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=115))

> "**(Yellow)** - The time horizon should extend far enough back in history to show how the problem emerged and describe its symptoms. It should extend far enough into the future to capture the delayed and indirect effects of potential policies" 
>([Sterman 2000:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=115))

> "**(Yellow)** - Most people dramatically underestimate the length of time delays and select time horizons that" 
>([Sterman 2000:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=115))

> "**(Yellow)** - are far too short" 
>([Sterman 2000:116](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=116))

#### **(Orange)** - A long time horizon is a critical antidote to the event-oriented worldview so crippling to our ability to identify patterns of behavior and the feedback structures generating them

> "**(Yellow)** - A good rule of thumb is to set the time horizon several times as long as the longest time delays in the system, and then some." 
>([Sterman 2000:119](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=119))

#### **(Orange)** - dynamic because it must provide an explanation of the dynamics characterizing the problem in terms of the underlying feedback and stock and flow structure of the system

#### **(Orange)** - hypothesis because it is always provisional

> "**(Yellow)** - A dynamic hypothesis is a working theory of how the problem arose." 
>([Sterman 2000:120](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=120))

#### **(Orange)** - Many times the purpose of the model is to solve a critically important problem that has persisted for years and generated great conflict and not a little animosity among members of the client team. All will tenaciously advocate their positions while deriding the views of others in the group

> "**(Yellow)** - Early in the modeling process, the modeler needs to act as a facilitator, capturing these mental models without criticizing or filtering them" 
>([Sterman 2000:120](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=120))

> "**(Yellow)** - the modeler's role during this early phase is to be a thoughtful listener, not a content expert." 
>([Sterman 2000:120](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=120))

> "**(Yellow)** - g how the system is structured and the rules of interaction (the decision rules in the system)" 
>([Sterman 2000:120](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=120))

#### **(Orange)** - explore how the behavior might change if you alter the structure and rules

#### **(Orange)** - The consequences of narrow model boundaries and reliance on exogenous variables are often serious

> "**(Yellow)** - Model boundary chart" 
>([Sterman 2000:122](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=122))

#### **(Orange)** - Often, models are used not as tools of inquiry but as weapons in a war of advocacy. In such cases modelers seek to hide the assumptions of their models from potential critics

> "**(Yellow)** - Subsystem diagram." 
>([Sterman 2000:124](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=124))

> "**(Yellow)** - A subsystem diagram shows the overall architecture of a model. Each major subsystem is shown along with the flows of material, money, goods, information, and so on coupling the subsystems to one another." 
>([Sterman 2000:124](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=124))

> "**(Yellow)** - Causal loop diagrams." 
>([Sterman 2000:127](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=127))

> "**(Yellow)** - Stock and flow maps" 
>([Sterman 2000:127](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=127))

> "**(Yellow)** - Policy structure diagrams" 
>([Sterman 2000:127](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=127))

> "**(Yellow)** - The behavior of a system arises from its structure. That structure consists of the feedback loops, stocks and flows, and nonlinearities created by the interaction" 
>([Sterman 2000:132](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=132))

> "**(Yellow)** - growth arises from positive feedback, goal seeking arises from negative feedback, and oscillation arises from negative feedback with time delays in the loop" 
>([Sterman 2000:133](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=133))

> "**(Yellow)** - Exponential growth arises from positive (self-reinforcing) feedback." 
>([Sterman 2000:133](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=133))

#### **(Orange)** - What about linear growth? Linear growth is actually quite rare. Linear growth requires that there be no feedback from the state of the system to the net increase rate, because the net increase remains constant even as the state of the system changes

> "**(Yellow)** - What appears to be linear growth is often actually exponential, but viewed over a time horizon too short to observe the acceleration." 
>([Sterman 2000:134](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=134))

> "**(Yellow)** - Often, however, the term "rate" is used as shorthand for thefractional rate of change of a variable." 
>([Sterman 2000:136](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=136))

> "**(Yellow)** - You must carefully distinguish between absolute and fractional rates of change and between rates of change and ratios. Select variable names that minimize the chance for confusion. Be sure to check the units of measure for your rates. The units of measure for rates of flow are unitskime period; the units of measure for fractional rates of flow are units per unit per time period = l/time period" 
>([Sterman 2000:136](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=136))

> "**(Yellow)** - Negative feedback loops act to bring the state of the system in line with a goal or desired state" 
>([Sterman 2000:136](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=136))

> "**(Yellow)** - Like goal-seeking behavior, oscillations are caused by negative feedback loops." 
>([Sterman 2000:139](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=139))

> "**(Yellow)** - In an oscillatory system, the state of the system constantly overshoots its goal or equilibrium state, reverses, then undershoots, and so on. The overshooting arises from the presence of significant time delays in the negative loop" 
>([Sterman 2000:139](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=139))

> "**(Yellow)** - The time delays cause corrective actions to continue even after the state of the system reaches its goal, forcing the system to adjust too much, and triggering a new correction in the opposite direction" 
>([Sterman 2000:139](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=139))

> "**(Yellow)** - The connection between structure and behavior provides a useful heuristic for the conceptualization process" 
>([Sterman 2000:141](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=141))

> "**(Yellow)** - In addition, it is essential to consider what structures exist but have not yet played a significant role in the history of the system or left a trace in the available data." 
>([Sterman 2000:142](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=142))

> "**(Yellow)** - -growth is exponential at first, but then gradually slows until the state of the system reaches an equilibrium level." 
>([Sterman 2000:143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=143))

> "**(Yellow)** - A system generates S-shaped growth only if two critical conditions are met. First, the negative loops must not include any significant time delays" 
>([Sterman 2000:144](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=144))

> "**(Yellow)** - Second, the carrying capacity must be fixed." 
>([Sterman 2000:145](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=145))

> "**(Yellow)** - A key aspect of the structure generating S-shaped growth is that the interaction of the positive and negative loops must be nonlinear" 
>([Sterman 2000:146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=146))

#### **(Orange)** - The inflection point in the curve is the point where the system, though still growing, shifts from acceleration to deceleration

> "**(Yellow)** - Time delays in the negative loops lead to the possibility that the state of the system will overshoot and oscillate around the carrying capacity" 
>([Sterman 2000:146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=146))

> "**(Yellow)** - S-shaped growth is that the carrying capacity is fixed. Often, however, the ability of the environment to support a growing population is eroded or consumed by the population itself" 
>([Sterman 2000:148](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=148))

> "**(Yellow)** - Consumption or erosion of the carrying capacity by the population creates a second negative feedback limiting growth" 
>([Sterman 2000:148](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=148))

> "**(Yellow)** - locally stable: perturbations will cause the system to oscillate, but it will eventually return to the same equilibrium." 
>([Sterman 2000:154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=154))

>([Sterman 2000:156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=156))

#### **(Orange)** - In the steady state, after the effects of any initial perturbations have died out, a limit cycle follows a particular orbit (closed curve) in state space

#### **(Orange)** - The steady state orbit is known as an attractor, since trajectories near enough to it will move toward it

> "**(Yellow)** - unlike limit cycles, a chaotic system fluctuates irregularly, never exactly repeating, even though its motion is completely deterministic."

#### **(Orange)** - The irregularity arises endogenously and is not created by external, random shocks

>([Sterman 2000:157](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=157))

> "**(Yellow)** - The motion of a chaotic system never repeats; instead, the orbits of the system approach what is known as a strange attractor-a set of closely related but slightly different orbits rather than a single closed curve"

> "**(Yellow)** - Furthermore, chaotic systems have the property known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions." 
>([Sterman 2000:157](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=157))

#### **(Orange)** - Sensitive dependence means that the prediction horizon for chaotic systems-the length of time over which forecasts of future behavior are accurateis likely to be short even if our model of the system structure and parameter estimates are perfect

> "**(Yellow)** - CLDs are excellent for Quickly capturing your hypotheses about the causes of dynamics; Eliciting and capturing the mental models of individuals or teams; Communicating the important feedbacks you believe are responsible for a problem."

> "**(Yellow)** - Link polarities describe the structure of the system. They do not describe the behavior of the variables. That is, they describe what would happen IF there were a change." 
>([Sterman 2000:164](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=164))

#### **(Orange)** - First, a variable often has more than one input. To determine what actually happens you need to know how all the inputs are changing

#### **(Orange)** - When assessing the polarity of individual links, assume all other variables are constant

#### **(Orange)** - When assessing the actual behavior of a system, all variables interact simultaneously (all else is not equal) and computer simulation is usually needed to trace out the behavior of the system and determine which loops are dominant

> "**(Yellow)** - causal loop diagrams do not distinguish between stocks and flows-the accumulations of resources in a system and the rates of change that alter those resources" 
>([Sterman 2000:165](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=165))

#### **(Orange)** - The s and o notation was motivated by a desire to make causal diagrams even easier to understand for people with little mathematical background

#### **(Orange)** - the statement "X and Y move in the same direction" is not in general correct, for the reasons stated above. The correct statement is, "If X increases, Y increases above what it would have been."

#### **(Orange)** - The s and o definitions also don't work for stock and flow relationships.

> "**(Yellow)** - Correlations among variables reflect the past behavior of a system. Correlations do not represent the structure of the system" 
>([Sterman 2000:166](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=166))

#### **(Orange)** - If circumstances change, if previously dormant feedback loops become dominant, if new policies are tried, previously reliable correlations among variables may break down

> "**(Yellow)** - The fast way to tell if a loop is positive or negative is to count the number of negative links in the loop. If the number of negative links is even, the loop is positive; if the number is odd, the loop is negative" 
>([Sterman 2000:169](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=169))

#### **(Orange)** - . Why might it fail? In a complex diagram it is all too easy to miscount the number of negative links in a loop. And it is easy to mislabel the polarity of links when you first draw the diagram

> "**(Yellow)** - The right way to determine the polarity of a loop is to trace the effect of a small change in one of the variables as it propagates around the loop. If the feedback effect reinforces the original change, it is a positive loop; if it opposes the original change, it is a negative loop" 
>([Sterman 2000:169](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=169))

> "**(Yellow)** - When you determine loop polarity, you are calculating what is known in control theory as the sign of the open loop gain of the loop. The term "gain" refers to the strength of the signal returned by the loop:" 
>([Sterman 2000:170](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=170))

#### **(Orange)** - The term "open loop" means the gain is calculated for just one feedback cycle by breaking-opening-the loop at some point.

#### **(Orange)** - Sometimes people say a link can be either positive or negative, depending on other parameters or on where the system is operating

> "**(Yellow)** - When you have trouble assigning a clear and unambiguous polarity to a link it usually means there is more than one causal pathway connecting the two variables. You should make these different pathways explicit in your diagram" 
>([Sterman 2000:171](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=171))

> "**(Yellow)** - To help your audience navigate the network of loops, it's helpful to give each important feedback a number and a name." 
>([Sterman 2000:173](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=173))

#### **(Orange)** - Naming the loops helps your audience understand the function of each loop and provides useful shorthand for discussion.

> "**(Yellow)** - When working with a client group, it's often possible to get them to name the loop. Many times, they will suggest a whimsical phrase or some organization-specific jargon for each loop."

> "**(Yellow)** - Your causal diagrams should include delays that are important to the dynamic hypothesis or significant relative to your time horizon" 
>([Sterman 2000:175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=175))

#### **(Orange)** - delays always involve stock and flow structures

#### **(Orange)** - Sometimes it is important to show these structures explicitly in your diagrams. Often, however, it is sufficient to indicate the presence of a time delay in a causal link without explicitly showing the stock and flow structure.

> "**(Yellow)** - The variable names in causal diagrams and models should be nouns or noun phrases" 
>([Sterman 2000:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=177))

> "**(Yellow)** - Choose names for which the meaning of an increase or decrease is clear, variables that can be larger or smaller. Without a clear sense of direction for the variables you will not be able to assign meaningful link polarities" 
>([Sterman 2000:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=177))

> "**(Yellow)** - Variable names should be chosen so their normal sense of direction is positive." 
>([Sterman 2000:178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=178))

> "**(Yellow)** - If your audience doesn't grasp the logic of a causal link, you should make some of the intermediate variables more explicit"

#### **(Orange)** - Short-term memory can hold 7 t chunks of information at once

> "**(Yellow)** - Build up your model in stages, with a series of smaller causal loop diagrams. Each diagram should correspond to one part of the dynamic story being told. Few people can understand a complex causal diagram unless they have a chance to digest the pieces one at a time. Develop a separate diagram for each important loop."

>([Sterman 2000:180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=180))

#### **(Orange)** - Goals can vary over time and respond to pressures in the environment.

#### **(Orange)** - Semistructured interviews

#### **(Orange)** - Typically, people will not describe all the links you may see and will not explicitly close many feedback loops. Should you add these additional links? It depends on the purpose of your diagram. If you are trying to represent a person's mental model, you must not include any links that cannot be grounded in the person's own statements. However, you may choose to show the initial diagram to the person and invite him or her to elaborate or add any missing links.

> "**(Yellow)** - If the purpose of your interviews is to develop a good model of the problem situation, you should supplement the links suggested by the interviews with other data sources" 
>([Sterman 2000:183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=183))

> "**(Yellow)** - ? It's usually best to begin by capturing the physical structure of the system. Systems consist of both a physical structure and the decision rules used by the people in the system (the behavioral structure). The physical structure is often easier to visualize and represent than the decision-making structure" 
>([Sterman 2000:204](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q77ZSSKK?page=204))

#### **(Orange)** - Additionally, conceptualization is often part of a group process in which people must share their own mental models and reach agreement over a single representation. It is usually easier to gain agreement about the physical structure. The behavioral structure is often more controversial; if you start there your group process may grind to a halt before you've really begun

#### **(Orange)** - There is no technological solution to the congestion problem. The more effectively these technologies increase highway capacity, the more trips will be taken, the more people will buy cars, the less attractive public transit will be, and the more countryside will be developed into bedroom communities for commuters. The volume of traffic will swiftly rise to absorb all the new capacity technology can yield. W

#### **(Orange)** - Curiously, the impact of the Iranian revolution on the flow of oil to the US was small. True, US oil imports from the Persian Gulf (including Iran) fell by 500,000 barrels per day between 1978 and 1979, about 3% of US consumption, but imports from other nations increased by 640,000 barrels per day, so imports in 1979 actually increased by 140,000 barrels per day. Domestic production fell by 150,000 barrels per day, so total supply was essentially constant, while consumption fell by about 330,000 barrels per day, a drop of 2% from 1978. Plainly, for the year as a whole, there was no shortage. But if the flow of oil into the US was essentially constant, what caused the shortage? Where did the gas go?

> "**(Yellow)** - it is wise to identify the main stocks in a system and then the flows that alter those stocks. You must select an appropriate level of aggregation and boundary for these stock and flow maps. The level of aggregation refers to the number of internal categories or stocks represented. The boundary refers to how far upstream and downstream one chooses to represent the flows of materials and other quantities in the model."

#### **(Orange)** - The stock and flow map for the assembly process might be shown as in Figure 6-12.

#### **(Orange)** - The three chains are linked because each car beginning the final assembly process requires one engine from the stock of completed engines and one chassis from the stock of completed chassis. T

#### **(Orange)** - The number of engines and chassis available also determine the maximum assembly start rate, which in turn constrains actual assembly starts:

#### **(Orange)** - As a rule of thumb, clients generally want to see more detail in a model than the modeler thinks is needed, and modelers, in turn, generally overestimate the detail necessary to capture the dynamics of interest

#### **(Orange)** - Of course, the amount of detail needed to capture the dynamics relevant to the client's purpose and the amount of detail needed to give the client confidence in the results are two different things.

#### **(Orange)** - Success requires you to include the detail necessary to satisfy the client. But this does not mean you should acquiesce to all client demands for more detail

#### **(Orange)** - You must work with the client to understand why excessive detail is often unnecessary

#### **(Orange)** - see Ford and Sterman 1998b for a detailed and fully documented model of a multiphase project similar to the one used here

> "**(Yellow)** - challenge the clouds." Is it appropriate for your purpose to exclude the stocks outside the boundary of the model? What feedbacks ignored by your model might exist in the real world, and might they affect your policy recommendations? Can the sources for the flows be depleted and constrain the inflow?
