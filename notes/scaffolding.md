> Scaffolding refers to the steps taken to reduce the degrees of freedom in carrying out some task so that the child can concentrate on the difficult skill she is in the process of acquiring' [^1]
> <div class=signature>Jerome  Bruner , 1978, p. 19</div>

- Scaffolding involves *helpful, structured interaction* to help a child *achieve a specific goal*
- It is done by:
	- Simplifying the task or idea.
	- Motivating and encouraging the child.
	- Highlighting important task elements or errors.
	- Giving models that can be imitated.
- Scaffolding is very similar to [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s concept of [[zone of proximal development]]
