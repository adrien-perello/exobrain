- A Is part of B / B includes A
- A Made B / B is made by A
- A Uses B / B is used by A
- A refers to B / B is referred to by A


## Use case

- From a human perspective:
	- the link context is an explanation on why you should follow a link. A good link context explains what you can expect if you follow the link. But it can also explain the nature of the relationship between both notes. Capturing this explicit reasoning is the very thing that makes linking truly productive by creating a network of meaningful connected knowledge.
- From a machine perspective
	- To make notes not only human readable but also machine parsable would allow for:
		- better backlinks feature, for example:
			- group autogenerated backlinks by link relationship type (i.e. agrees vs refutes). See [Pandocs Scholas](https://github.com/pandoc-scholar/pandoc-scholar) and [CiTO ontology](https://sparontologies.github.io/cito/current/cito.html) for examples of semantic citations.
		- text querriable by sparql or cypher



## Linking current note to another one

### Using the semantic mediawiki syntax

[message from @usergenic](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-support-for-link-types/6994/17)

> In the "Berlin.md" page, adding the following link:
> ```
> [[Is Capital of::Germany]]
> ```
> establishes the relationship:  Berlin --> Is Capital of --> Germany

Also [mentioned by @msteffens](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-support-for-link-types/6994/21)

> in idea_1.md, adding the following:
> ```
> The ideas in this note are further extendend in [[is extended by::idea_2]]
> ```
> idea_1 --> Is extended by --> Idea_2

- Pros:
	- very similar to natural reading
- Cons:
	-  doesn't allow adding properties


### variations of the semantic mediawiki syntax
[message from @usergenic](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-support-for-link-types/6994/20)

> In the "Berlin.md" page, adding the following link:
> ```
> [[Germany#:is capital of]]
> ```
> renders in the HTML as:  "Germany > :is capital of"

Also mentioned here

 using this syntax [[property1=value|property2=value::linkType::name|alias]]
 
> in "recipe_A.md", adding the following:
> ```
> This recipe requires 20 grams of [[quantity=20 grams::ingredient::Rice|rice]]
> ```


using this syntax [[name|alias|linkType|property1=value|property2=value]]

> in "recipe_A.md", adding the following:
> ```
>This recipe requires 20 grams of [[Rice|rice|ingredient|quantity=20 grams]]
> ```

- Pros:
	- more similar to natural reading
	- .
- Cons:
	- .

## Linking any note to another one

### Using N triples / turtle syntax
[message from @malecjan](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-support-for-link-types/6994/32)

> ```
> [[link1]] [link2](link2) <http://example.com/link3>
> ```
> would become "(link1)--[link2]-->(http://example.com/link3)# in Cypher.

Also [mentioned by @Emile][https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-support-for-link-types/6994/35]
> ```
> - linkType [[note 1]], [[note 2|alias]]
> ```

- Pros:5
	- .
	- .
- Cons:
	- if the first element (say *note 1*) of the triple is not recognized (for example because of a typo), the text will regarded as free-form text, therefore creating an **unwanted link** from the **current** note to *note 2*
	- .


### Using Neo4j syntax
[message from @tuckytoo](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-support-for-link-types/6994/28)

> ```
> (:person) --[:works for]â€“>(:company)  
> (:person) --[:owns]â€“>(:car)
> ```

- Pros:
	- .
	- .
- Cons:
	- .
	- .


### Using Aspen Syntax
[message from @tuckytoo](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-support-for-link-types/6994/29):

> ```
> default Person, name
> default_attribute Employer, company_name
> reciprocal knows, is friends with
> 
> # Write out the narrative data
> (Matt) [is friends with] (Brianna).
> (Eliza) [knows] (Brianna).
> (Matt) [is friends with] (Eliza).
> 
> (Matt) [works for] (Employer, UMass Boston).
> ```

- Pros:
	- .
	- .
- Cons:
	- .
	- .

### Using the existing markdown metadata/attribute syntax

[message from @malecjan](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-support-for-link-types/6994/30)

(this one is not so clear to me)

> ```
> ---
> id: NoteMe
> title: king Me
> aliases: [little king, small king]
> ---
> # king Me
> King Me had three children: 
> - [Alice](noteA){link-type: parent-child}
> - [Bob](NoteB){link-type: parent-child, probability: 1}
> - [Charlie](NoteC){id: LinkID123, link-type: parent-child, probability: 0.5, paired-link: "C#LinkID124"}
> ```

- Pros:
	- .
	- .
- Cons:
	- .
	- .


### Option 7


- Pros:
	- .
	- .
- Cons:
	- .
	- .


## What about symetry?

```
[[optional link type(s)::LINKID|optional link title]]
```

Examples (for reasons of simplicity, w/o any link title/alias name after the LINKID):

```
[[supports::LINKID]]
[[refutes::LINKID]]
[[is confirmed by::LINKID]]
```
