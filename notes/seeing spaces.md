# Notes
- how could computer desk and maker space be more like:

- to move away from non scientific and tinkering thinking

### seeing inside
- Current design process
	- prototype with minimum elements to spot what works and what don't
- what if prototype would collect and display all its data?

### seeing across time
- what if you could see across time to:
	- compare changes
	- search through history

### seeing across possibilities
- current process:
	- change a parameter and run an experiment
- what if could go through an entire range of settings and access the data afterwards ?
- and what if the representation were such that it is easy understand the behavior?
