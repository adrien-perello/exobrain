created in the late 1970s by Werner Kunz and Horst Rittel.

IBIS notation has three elements: issues, ideas, and arguments.

**Issues**

Issues are the problems or questions being discussed. On the diagram, these are typically framed as questions (e.g., “What should we do about X”).

Issues can be independent or connected to another issue, position, or argument. This allows the team to question and consider every element, giving the group a more comprehensive picture of the main problem.  

**Ideas**

Ideas (or positions) are the responses and proposed solutions to the issue(s). Within IBIS notation, ideas can only respond to issues. This is typically notated with an arrow directed from the idea node to the issue node.

**Arguments**

Arguments are either for or against an idea (i.e., pros or cons). Arguments are key to mapping out a full analysis with perspectives from different backgrounds. On the map, arguments are only connected to ideas, describing the group’s multiple viewpoints on each idea.
